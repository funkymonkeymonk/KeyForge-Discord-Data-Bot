It does not take the ability of creatures to reap into account, unless they are a special skill that will usually generate extra aember, like Dew Faerie\'s "Reap: Gain 1 Æmber Some cards that are difficult to play have their base aember reduced, and some cards that immediately allow the use of creatures have aember added on the assumption creatures will be used to reap.')

				.addField('C: Creature Control', 'Creature control is increased by cards that directly damage, destroy, disable or prevent the play of enemy creatures. It does not account for your creatures\' power, although it does account for special abilities that encourage using a creature to fight. 1 point is approximately equal to destroying one 3 power creature or stunning 2 creatures.')
